- L21 (Evanora (Juls)): "I'm very confused as to how he's talking because it shows he's mute on my end."
- L22 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Please like and subscribe!"
- L23 (Keemin (DM)): "Yeah, so..."
- L24 (Minx (Caterson)): "I think it's Tech2Speak."
- L25 (Keemin (DM)): "one thing you guys"
- L26 (Keemin (DM)): "should know is that if you address this guy by his name, he will respond to you."
- L27 (Evanora (Juls)): "Ow!"
- L28 (Minx (Caterson)): "Damn."
- L29 (Minx (Caterson)): "Is this your machine learning project for this campaign?"
- L30 (Minx (Caterson)): "are Utah."
- L31 (Keemin (DM)): "Yeah, I mean, I don't know if there's that much machine learning involved just yet. Right now it's it's a lot of just LLM stuff, but yeah, I've probably worked on Meepo for around like 40 to 50 hours."
- L32 (Evanora (Juls)): "Damn!"
- L33 (Keemin (DM)): "Yeah, yeah, okay."
- L34 (Louis (Jojo)): "Thanks for joining us. Have a great day. Bye."
- L35 (Minx (Caterson)): "Alright, I'm going to just refer to the creature as M if I don't want to trigger it."
- L36 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): ". . . . . ."
- L37 (Minx (Caterson)): "But do you just tie it to, like, an existing..."
- L38 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Mr. M."
- L39 (Keemin (DM)): "Yeah, I mean, if it's annoying."
- L40 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "and probably that's all."
- L41 (Keemin (DM)): "If it's annoying, we can demote this guy to only be able to talk in the chat, but yeah."
- L42 (Louis (Jojo)): "Meepo, what's your favorite color?"
- L43 (Evanora (Juls)): "Oh!"
- L44 (Louis (Jojo)): "How does it feel to... How do you feel a color?"
- L45 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Hmm"
- L46 (Minx (Caterson)): "Wait, do you just tie this to, like, an existing AI service, or is there..."
- L47 (Minx (Caterson)): "Oh my goodness."
- L48 (Keemin (DM)): "I built this, but yeah, at its core, it does make calls to like OpenAI's API."
- L49 (Minx (Caterson)): "Okay, I see."
- L50 (Louis (Jojo)): "🤣🤣🤣"
- L51 (Keemin (DM)): "At its core, yes, but..."
- L52 (Evanora (Juls)): "Oh God!"
- L53 (Louis (Jojo)): "Meepo, call 9-1-1"
- L54 (Keemin (DM)): "but clearly, clearly many things have been changed as this probably does not remind you of any instance of ChatGPT you've ever spoken with."
- L55 (Minx (Caterson)): "Useless!"
- L56 (Snowflake (Panda)): "I know right, he keeps talking about helping but he doesn't know anything."
- L57 (Evanora (Juls)): "Meepo, can you hurl an insult?"
- L58 (Snowflake (Panda)): "ha ha"
- L59 (Evanora (Juls)): "Meepo, say fuck."
- L60 (Minx (Caterson)): "Okay, now I kind of hear the chat GBT."
- L61 (Keemin (DM)): "I'm gonna put Meepo on text mode for now so that he doesn't cause too much of a ruckus but yes so that that is Meepo y'all he will"
- L62 (Minx (Caterson)): "OH NO!"
- L63 (Louis (Jojo)): "I'm lost!"
- L64 (Evanora (Juls)): "I don't know. I don't know."
- L65 (Snowflake (Panda)): "LOL"
- L66 (Keemin (DM)): "will be actually joining the campaign in the world, in the actual game as well. But of course, you know, there's some immersion break because Meepo is also a DM assistant. And so one of the many incredible things Meepo can do is keep track."
- L67 (Louis (Jojo)): "..."
- L68 (Keemin (DM)): "I think you guys should still keep track of everybody's meeps and you know it is kind of going to be a transition type thing where like you know some of this stuff is testing still so you guys should I think you guys should still keep track of them you know the way that we've been doing it but hopefully"
- L69 (Keemin (DM)): "Hopefully over time it will start to take over more of the bookkeeping and logistical stuff. I realize that as the campaign gets more and more complex and there's lots of numbers"
- L70 (Keemin (DM)): "And even like eventually the character feature stuff that we have to keep track of it'll just be helpful to have somebody To do it for us automatically so That was kind of the idea But yeah, let's not let's not get too bogged down with it. I think I think we should um we I have a pretty"
- L71 (Keemin (DM)): "I don't want to spoil anything you guys can discover for yourselves, but"
- L72 (Keemin (DM)): "As always, at the start of the session, we should begin with our session recap, so..."
- L73 (Keemin (DM)): "Anybody who would like to do that, please take the floor."
- L74 (Snowflake (Panda)): "all right well last session we were doing the final"
- [L1 m=0.45 s=1.11 span L75–L76 center=L76]
  - L75 (Snowflake (Panda)): "And the final trial of the, how do you say, what was that block called? It wasn't training block."
  - L76 (Keemin (DM)): "The Cook Bloc"
- L77 (Snowflake (Panda)): "The Cook Block"
- L78 (Snowflake (Panda)): "So, we can't answer all of them."
- L79 (Snowflake (Panda)): "We came back to the last trial of Cook Block after everybody passed the fire."
- L80 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Tiles, and uh... Donated a lot of"
- L81 (Snowflake (Panda)): "blood to the shrine for whatever reason it needed it. and went through the group. How do you..."
- L82 (Snowflake (Panda)): "labyrinth of wolf heads that shoot arrows, where Jamison decided to show his wonderful skills of destroying stuff and making impossible love happen."
- L83 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Um..."
- L84 (Snowflake (Panda)): "We make it through, mostly intact, maybe one or two hours."
- L85 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Rose, Hits, but that doesn't bother anybody. We get to the room with a lot of food."
- L86 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Everybody, well not everybody, Snowflake stuffs herself, Evanora snatches all of the pillows, all of it. uh, all of the curr-"
- L87 (Snowflake (Panda)): "and we decide not to rest and go to the next room and fight the giant thing although we don't have to fight the giant thing but we do it because YOLO the giant minotaur that forms out of blood of Louis, Jamison and Evanora doesn't seem to digest the blood of Louis very well which helps in a fight however"
- L88 (Snowflake (Panda)): "It is still pretty strong, so during the fight..."
- L89 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Evanora almost dies."
- L90 (Snowflake (Panda)): "and learns about the"
- L91 (Snowflake (Panda)): "death of her mother."
- L92 (Snowflake (Panda)): "and"
- L93 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Somehow that"
- L94 (Snowflake (Panda)): "triggers the Minotaur to..."
- L95 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Dissipate itself, woohoo, so"
- L96 (Snowflake (Panda)): "The E"
- L97 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Team Wins!"
- L98 (Snowflake (Panda)): "which shocks everybody in the audience. Everybody is so excited. And then we see the Poros, I think, do the trials."
- L99 (Snowflake (Panda)): "And they are so organized, and they are so cool, and we see two teams go through. And we are so excited to see the culmination. Maybe Puros will also find the Minotaurs."
- L100 (Snowflake (Panda)): "But no."
- L101 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Something happens and the trials are stopped."
- L102 (Snowflake (Panda)): "And everybody is sent to their..."
- L103 (Snowflake (Panda)): "respective waters, and guards are so busy that they forget to to take our weapons."
- L104 (Snowflake (Panda)): "And I think everybody who wants to can hide their weapons."
- L105 (Snowflake (Panda)): "anywhere they want to."
- L106 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Snowflake hid a dagger in a mattress and in a..."
- L107 (Snowflake (Panda)): "so far, and then... We were on a bus so guys"
- [L2 m=2.97 s=2.23 span L108–L121 center=L114]
  - [L1 m=0.45 s=1.14 span L108–L119 center=L114]
    - L108 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Got two arcane and medium arcane crystals that might explode tonight. Who knows? Snowflake is unstable."
    - L109 (Snowflake (Panda)): "And then we learn that the lockdown happened because somebody murdered Lord of Vail."
    - L110 (Snowflake (Panda)): "And the prime suspects now are..."
    - L111 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Meeks and Jamison"
    - L112 (Minx (Caterson)): "I'll know"
    - L113 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Oh no, they were the last ones talking and who were serving him food, so that's what made them prime suspects."
    - L114 (Snowflake (Panda)): "But Mr. Lord Pincushion really thinks that it's Cyril Fargo's doing, but he has no proof yet."
    - L115 (Snowflake (Panda)): "And I think that's about..."
    - L116 (Snowflake (Panda)): "It beyond the Louis and Evanora's"
    - L117 (Snowflake (Panda)): "and soothing chat about..."
    - L118 (Snowflake (Panda)): "What happened to her mother?"
    - L119 (Keemin (DM)): "Yep."
  - L120 (Keemin (DM)): "So, speaking of which..."
  - L121 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Was it two things? I think it was more..."
- L122 (Keemin (DM)): "Speaking of which, I will reward each of you guys."
- L123 (Keemin (DM)): "Louis and Evanora with one more Meep for that. Pc Interactive"
- L124 (Keemin (DM)): "Snowflake. Great work as well. I think I already awarded you a Meepo offline from last time. So let me just check to make sure that you do have..."
- L125 (Keemin (DM)): "Two Meeps, which is what it should be, yep. And otherwise, I guess, couple tweaks on the... on just like the specifics of some of the things that happened, so... The Minotaur, yeah, I..."
- L126 (Keemin (DM)): "It got blood from Snowflake, from Jamison, and Evanora. Or, sorry, not Snowflake. Snowflake, Louis, Jamison, and Evanora."
- L127 (Louis (Jojo)): "Yeah."
- L128 (Keemin (DM)): "And you guys kind of noticed that each, you know,"
- L129 (Keemin (DM)): "owners, blood, kind of contributed some properties that they had, whether it be magical resistance that was interfering with like the, the arc."
- L130 (Louis (Jojo)): "Thank you."
- L131 (Keemin (DM)): "The rage properties of Jamison's and whatever it is that happened with Evanora's blood, that was very strange. The other thing with the Poros is that they actually completed their Fleshing Arena run, they just all opted to not fight their Minotaurs. So they just very quickly completed their runs on area 5 instead of heading to area 6."
- L132 (Louis (Jojo)): "Because they're cowards."
- L133 (Keemin (DM)): "And yeah, I think those two are the main things. I don't think I'm, uh, kind of forgot if there's anything else, sorry."
- L134 (Louis (Jojo)): "I said because they're cowards, they don't want to take it."
- L135 (Louis (Jojo)): "Take the challenge!"
- L136 (Evanora (Juls)): "Oh yeah, and also, we might be the fastest ones to have completed it, so... My"
- L137 (Keemin (DM)): "You guys may have been the fastest ones to complete the gauntlet run, that's correct."
- L138 (Keemin (DM)): "And as for, yeah, BuzzsawGuy, Snowflake managed to beat the entire game and instead of, you know, just a normal victory screen, the entire Chroma decided to..."
- L139 (Keemin (DM)): "to the Theseus region."
- L140 (Keemin (DM)): "for whatever reason, Cyril apparently is still the prime suspect."
- L141 (Louis (Jojo)): "Even when he's not here, he's causing shit."
- L142 (Keemin (DM)): "And, um, yeah, do we have any questions or any clarifications before..."
- L143 (Keemin (DM)): "before we hop into the session proper."
- L144 (Louis (Jojo)): "No, but I will not be using dice this session. I have a new spinny gif thing that Evanora got me that I-"
- L145 (Keemin (DM)): "Pleeeaaase"
- L146 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Ohhh!"
- L147 (Louis (Jojo)): "push a button it's almost like a pocket watch and it spins things inside of it so it has all the numbers i was trying"
- L148 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Pinkford didn't happen! Ha, ha, ha."
- L149 (Louis (Jojo)): "I am trying to, but Discord is not letting me take a picture, so I have to take a picture through the app and then send it through the camera."
- L150 (Louis (Jojo)): "doesn't like to do it."
- L151 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Hello?"
- L152 (Louis (Jojo)): "You do one each side."
- L153 (Keemin (DM)): "So yeah, do send a pic whenever you get a chance."
- L154 (Evanora (Juls)): "It has a really cool mechanical dragon, it's really cool."
- L155 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Ha, Ha, Ha"
- L156 (Keemin (DM)): "Yep."
- L157 (Keemin (DM)): "So..."
- L158 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Laugh"
- L159 (Evanora (Juls)): "If it doesn't..."
- L160 (Evanora (Juls)): "It's your fault, not mine."
- L161 (Louis (Jojo)): "It should be there soon, if it ever loads. But it's real cool, and I'm going to be using that today. Hopefully it doesn't steer me wrong! Oh! Oh! S-secretly had... It's..."
- L162 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Heheheheh President doesn't go to the Dice Jail Heheheheh"
- L163 (Louis (Jojo)): "Forever to the Dice Jew."
- L164 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Hehe"
- L165 (Evanora (Juls)): "Just eat it against the wall."
- L166 (Keemin (DM)): "So... If there are"
- L167 (Keemin (DM)): "There are no outstanding questions, oh, picture, let's see."
- L168 (Keemin (DM)): "Very cool, very... Was this like... Like a Valentine's Day gift?"
- L169 (Louis (Jojo)): "Yes."
- L170 (Keemin (DM)): "Very, very nice."
- L171 (Louis (Jojo)): "We have tastes."
- L172 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Wow!"
- L173 (Evanora (Juls)): "I'm making it- I'm making it a thing where I just get him fidgets for D&D."
- L174 (Evanora (Juls)): "This is like the third one, I believe."
- L175 (Louis (Jojo)): "I think so."
- L176 (Evanora (Juls)): "Yeah, it's the gag that I'm going with, just getting him D&D fidget spinners of sorts."
- L177 (Keemin (DM)): "I-"
- L178 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Oh, it's like a stopwatch!"
- L179 (Keemin (DM)): "You need one of those, I bet you fidget all the time."
- L180 (Snowflake (Panda)): "It's so cool!"
- L181 (Evanora (Juls)): "I can, I can send you the link."
- L182 (Keemin (DM)): "Thank you"
- L183 (Evanora (Juls)): "There's like different styles, there's like a shield one, there's that one, and I believe there's like a spellbook one."
- L184 (Evanora (Juls)): "They're pretty cool."
- L185 (Keemin (DM)): "Nice"
- L186 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Look at this hand reveal!"
- L187 (Snowflake (Panda)): "LAUGHING LAUGHING"
- L188 (Louis (Jojo)): "I know, scandalous, right? I have a hand. Whoever would have known."
- L189 (Evanora (Juls)): "Thank you. Bye. Bye."
- L190 (Keemin (DM)): "Alright guys, um, so..."
- L191 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Well, so far, I thought that's where it goes."
- L192 (Keemin (DM)): "Let's, uh, let's..."
- L193 (Keemin (DM)): "real things in and start our session. If there's no other questions I think the best place to jump back in is going to be when Lord Lord Pincushion returns. It happened at the tail end of last week but just to reiterate kind of what's been going on after hours of waiting and trying to you know decide what is going on, why there was the sudden lockdown, Lord Lord Pincushion returns alone and exhausted as he reveals that Lord Durfan Lord Derfawn Vale has been found in his quarters this morning and did not attend the gauntlet run because he was already dead when it began. he knows"
- L194 (Keemin (DM)): "notes that Cyril remains the primary suspect."
- L195 (Keemin (DM)): "Um, because, well, he kind of gives some kind of B.S.C. reasons, but, I mean, the gist of it is he has a history, violent action against Fleshing Arena staff, and quote-unquote,"
- L196 (Keemin (DM)): "other pieces of evidence. The main thing, though, in Lord Pittencushion's words, But Corah Malora's made up her mind, and around here her word is law. I'm afraid I can't go into further detail."
- L197 (Keemin (DM)): "And I'm sure you all know what this means, Cyril's basically as good as dead."
- L198 (Keemin (DM)): "And at that, you hear like a sharp inhale from Tolan over at Kayn's Corner as he just looks."
- L199 (Keemin (DM)): "a bit floored by this revelation"
- L200 (Keemin (DM)): "As for Jamison and Minx, to be honest, for the entire wing at this point, consider our odds of getting a cohort-sponsored next block to be reduced to Cyril."
- L201 (Keemin (DM)): "and hearing the silence echoing off the walls, lord pincushions."
- L202 (Keemin (DM)): "relatively calm demeanor finally breaks as he like you can almost see a vein popping out from from underneath his furred face as he yells oh wait sorry"
- L203 (Keemin (DM)): "Sorry, one sec, messed up the token, there we go."
- L204 (Keemin (DM)): "Maybe I'll just switch the music, but yeah, Lord Lord Pincushion goes... Do you have any idea how hard I worked to keep you off the board this week after the stunt you pulled in the green? in Room. Oh-"
- L205 (Keemin (DM)): "Wait, you do, because we had an entire chat and you promised to keep your heads down low moving forward."
- L206 (Snowflake (Panda)): "and the way"
- L207 (Snowflake (Panda)): "It's a video game It's fucking Youtube Oh shit Fuck Shut up Fuck Fuck Shut up Shut the fuck up Oh shit Shut up Oh shit Shut up Shut the fuck up Oh shit I did it I did it I did it I did it Yeah Fuck Yeah Fuck Fuck Fuck Oh should Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck I adjust I adjust I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit I edit"
- L208 (Keemin (DM)): "and he rubs his face in exasperation and now a noble is dead"
- L209 (Louis (Jojo)): "I did nothing. I have n-"
- L210 (Snowflake (Panda)): "HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaha"
- L211 (Louis (Jojo)): "Done literally nothing."
- L212 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Laughter"
- L213 (Keemin (DM)): "And it's at that very moment, Snowflake, that..."
- L214 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Jamison raises his hand."
- L215 (Keemin (DM)): "Lord Pincushion, Walt"
- L216 (Snowflake (Panda)): "and Zayden. Bye bye. Bye bye."
- L217 (Keemin (DM)): "We'll just do this last bit, so it's at that moment that Lord Pincushion notices the shattered pieces of the Chroma in the corner of the room with Snowflake still just sitting on the couch."
- L218 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Laughter"
- L219 (Keemin (DM)): "very pleased with herself he just sighs"
- L220 (Keemin (DM)): "And you, you lot were too good to be true. There's always a catch, and the catch is that all of you are batshit crazy."
- L221 (Snowflake (Panda)): "THE TV EXPLODED ON ITS OWN!"
- L222 (Snowflake (Panda)): "My chair moved. I had to get another to drag it down. I was like. That would have been a nice perfect shot. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I'm scared, sorry. It's my bad, it was my bad, sorry."
- L223 (Snowflake (Panda)): "I had no fault at that. It's not my fault that it doesn't..."
- [L2 m=5.55 s=4.41 span L224–L237 center=L224]
  - L224 (Snowflake (Panda)): "believe that I can win the game?"
  - L225 (Keemin (DM)): "Oh yeah, and I suppose Lord Derfawn Lord Derfawn Vale just went and offed himself too."
  - L226 (Snowflake (Panda)): "For all I know, I've been here doing all this, like, legal stuff."
  - L227 (Louis (Jojo)): "and I am not Doctor, I am not during the pandemic Doctor. Doctor. I am not forcing new diseases into us. Just noticing that we are not vulnerable to the potential effects"

    - L233 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Weren't you guys supposed to be keeping a watch on him?"
    - L234 (Keemin (DM)): "He's been taken into custody."
    - L235 (Keemin (DM)): "We, and we were, it's just, it's complicated. Just don't ask too many questions."
    - L236 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "I just don't understand how that falls on us. I mean, we kicked ass out there. We did a fantastic job. I don't know if you were watching."
    - L237 (Keemin (DM)): "It seems that your lot is very, very good at destruction."
- L238 (Keemin (DM)): "I never thought I'd say this, but usually the Fleshing Arena is the brutal player in the situation, but nowadays it feels like you-"

- L240 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Hey Jeff- Because"
- L241 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "I mean, did you see me make those-"

- L246 (Snowflake (Panda)): "to be. and Rip."
- L247 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "and this catapult."
- L248 (Snowflake (Panda)): "position of the suspicion doesn't mean that we... It's our fault. It's not our fault for being unlucky to be in the... Compromising situation! Just out of chance."
- L249 (Snowflake (Panda)): "I mean look at our luck! Even the TV exploded!"
- L250 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "I mean, especially when y'all were the ones in charge of them. It's not even like we could police our own people."
- L251 (Keemin (DM)): "Hmm, well, what's the sense in talking about it now? Why am I even arguing with you? The fact of the matter is, Cyril's head's on the chopping block, and it's only a matter of time before all of yours are too. That's the way I smell it."

    - L253 (Keemin (DM)): "All I know is, it's escalated to Corah Malora at this point. She's doing her best to try and figure out how the hell we're gonna PR this over."
  - L254 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Well, I'd imagine so. I mean, that was kind of a big boo-boo on y'all's part."

That is kind of how his house, his whole philosophy, that's how they've gotten so far as being almost like the knowledge nexus of the Gorgothian nobles.

Though many of the nobles kind of keep it on the hush hush because it's not viewed super favorably by like the peasantry and the common folk. Like they, it's a big entertainment event at this point.

    - L932 (Keemin (DM)): "It looks like red, you know, typical blood. Nothing crazy like the blood that some of you guys in the party have. On a slightly unrelated note, I'll say you guys do note that the fact that there's a rat there and there's like a gash there that looks like it must have been caused by some kind of weapon and, you know, weapons aren't normally allowed outside the Fleshing Arena. Forgot to mention this, but Corah Malora would have told you guys that Cyril was thoroughly patted down upon discovery of this whole incident and they found an arrowhead on his person. And they also found a bunch of rats all over him. And so that did kind of give them some amount of evidence that it could have been Cyril."
  - L933 (Louis (Jojo)): "Yeah, but the Airhead couldn't have done that."
  - L934 (Snowflake (Panda)): "..."
  - L935 (Evanora (Juls)): "Yeah, but another person we know that likes rats is Fig, and Fig is injured."

    - L940 (Keemin (DM)): "It looks like it could have been done by an arrowhead, but it is pretty. It's a pretty sizable and like slightly like messed up looking looking gash. It's like a pretty, pretty gnarly one to cut through hardwood like that."
- L941 (Evanora (Juls)): "Hmm."
- L942 (Louis (Jojo)): "And I couldn't hear you before what you were telling me to roll, there was too much noise."
- L943 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "like, comment, and subscribe thanks!"

- L948 (Louis (Jojo)): "Cyril. Okay, little thing gets up to you. Fourteen. That probably won't give me anything though."
- L949 (Keemin (DM)): "14"
- L950 (Keemin (DM)): "You do notice, Louis, looking very closely, it's kind of difficult to see at first because of the bloodstain. But around the bloodstain, there are just lots of, not quite gashes, but just small"
- L951 (Keemin (DM)): "I don't know if you can see it, but there are a lot of small skid marks as if many sharp objects were dragged around the hardwood. It's definitely a little bit scuffy."
- L952 (Evanora (Juls)): "Hmm..."
- L953 (Louis (Jojo)): "a point this out."
- L954 (Evanora (Juls)): "Yo, I think and Fig did it."

- L958 (Evanora (Juls)): "and"
- L959 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Aw!"
- L960 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "I mean, I think what we really need to look at. is what's on the other side of this door and and Jamison is just going to walk."
- L961 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "walk up to it, and uh... and just like kick it open."
- L962 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay We'll enter the room then."

  - L991 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Jameis, Jamison"
  - L992 (Keemin (DM)): "Who knows, but all you see right now is that the rug is normally just placed in the center of the room in a way that looks aesthetically appealing in the way that you imagine that it should be."
- L993 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Jamison's just going to walk up, not even say anything to anybody, and throw the rug back and see if there's anything hiding underneath it."
- L994 (Keemin (DM)): "And as you move to do that, one of the guards is just gonna, like, grab you by the arm. Hey, uh, no messing with the crime scene!"

It's like a basic Arcanum crystal inlaid magical bracelet that essentially allows you to refund or kind of draw some magical energy from it.

      - L1665 (Keemin (DM)): "Sister Valmyr kind of sighs. Well, it's quite likely that that would just be a technicality for him because he's an esteemed guest, a judge, and he certainly has paid quite a pretty sum to sponsor the events of the Fleshing Arena. I believe, you know, Lord Lord Pincushion would just have to do quite a bit of more paperwork."

    - L1667 (Keemin (DM)): "That is a little odd."
    - L1668 (Keemin (DM)): "that is a little odd indeed and it can't sit right on my conscience, I have to say this and Sister Valmula like bows like deeply as she says, I am terribly sorry for the accusations that I made early on in this investigation. You must understand that the evidence did point heavily to those of you who were present for his dinner. I apologize."

  - L1739 (Keemin (DM)): "And Cara will, like, quickly, you know, try to get a bead on how Fig's current state is. Not really your run-of-the-mill specimen, you know, not much to base it off of, but her brow furrows in concern. I think he's poisoned."

After the lockdown, Fig was chasing a rat down the hall, and door suddenly opened. Fig startled. Fig attacked. Lord Derfawn Lord Derfawn Vale is one of the judges. Fig startled him too. He swung at me. I clawed at his arm. He nicked my arm."

- L1779 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "That's a great question. Me and Minx thought it was lizard people, but Minx tried to pull the mask off and it didn't work, so I think it's just, uh, I think the other lizard person that eats faces might still be roaming around."
- L1780 (Louis (Jojo)): "the change people thing. Remember, we discussed this."

- L2073 (Keemin (DM)): "Nice, it's 12. So, Louis, it's your turn."
- L2074 (Keemin (DM)): "Um..."
- L2075 (Louis (Jojo)): "Louis watches this. I have seen Fig injured before. Has he ever had this weird black ichor? Because I know what Fig traded. I remember that. Because I thought it was dumb as a Louisian character if I recall."
- L2076 (Louis (Jojo)): "but..."
- L2077 (Keemin (DM)): "Uh, yes, Fig did, in fact, uh, like in the Fleshing Arena match and things like that, uh, when you saw him, like, the Trial of Vision, he got pretty busted up. This is pretty classic, trademark Fig, Icky Goo."
- L2078 (Louis (Jojo)): "Okay, I'm going to attempt to Grapple Fig."
- L2079 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay, uh, roll an athletics check."
- L2080 (Louis (Jojo)): "Okay, I have a plus two, uh, for that is just..."
- L2081 (Louis (Jojo)): "Button's stuck. Okay, there we go. Uh, not enough."
- L2082 (Keemin (DM)): "Yeah, Fig's form is like, very glitchy at the moment, he like, half shrinks down back into rat form, and you like, miss him for a split second."
- L2083 (Louis (Jojo)): "Gotcha"
- L2084 (Louis (Jojo)): "uh i can't do anything else because i don't i don't get two attacks unless i bonus action i don't think i can bonus action grapple them though unfortunately"
- L2085 (Keemin (DM)): "All right."
- L2086 (Snowflake (Panda)): "I mean, if it's a disguise, would it have fallen? I don't know. I don't do magic."
- L2087 (Louis (Jojo)): "I'm definitely going to be watching Fig like, hey, because I remember, so it's a little odd Fig doesn't remember because he loves what he was traded."
- L2088 (Keemin (DM)): "Evanora, it's your turn."
- L2089 (Louis (Jojo)): "But that's all I can do, but I'll kind of just move behind Fig though. That's it."
- L2090 (Louis (Jojo)): "I think her Discord's having a stroke."
- L2091 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay, so we'll move on to Snowflake for now."
- L2092 (Snowflake (Panda)): "All right."
- L2093 (Keemin (DM)): "Snowflake, help!"
- L2094 (Snowflake (Panda)): "I mean, he doesn't change into anybody."
- L2095 (Louis (Jojo)): "Thank you. Bye bye."
- L2096 (Snowflake (Panda)): "But if he is even more injured, she is winning the rat bet even harder. But at the same time, she already won. Hmm."
- L2097 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Snowflake will just, like, stand, like, stay put, so that..."
- L2098 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Like, they don't kill Fig, but whatever happens."
- L2099 (Snowflake (Panda)): "I mean, he did attack the rats on her territory. She's pretty upset with him."
- L2100 (Keemin (DM)): "Alright, so you're just chillin', hold Old Xoblob, and call Screeches out. The crows, the crows, festering around the body."
- L2101 (Evanora (Juls)): "Thank you, you're back."
- L2102 (Keemin (DM)): "At the start of Fig's turn, he's just going to take the dodge action as he tries to get a hold of himself. But you can definitely tell that something's kind of up with him as he almost seems like he's not really fully in control of his transformations. He half turns into a cow, then back into Fig, then into a rat, then back into Fig. And his voice itself is starting to get a little bit muffled as he goes, It's, it's, it was, I'm Fig, I'm Fig, I promise, I just don't remember, the stew, the stew, um, what was it, maybe an, I don't know, a ham, no, a stew, no, um, hmm."
- L2103 (Keemin (DM)): "Thick memory bad. Thick memory kind of bad."
- L2104 (Snowflake (Panda)): "and Mewtwo. I hope you enjoyed this video. I'll see you in the next one."
- L2105 (Louis (Jojo)): "Evanora is back, by the way."
- L2106 (Evanora (Juls)): "I'm back."
- L2107 (Keemin (DM)): "Evanora, anything you're doing on your turn?"
- L2108 (Evanora (Juls)): "Um, I don't know what's happening."
- L2109 (Louis (Jojo)): "We're trying."
- L2110 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Fig is acting very weird, and he doesn't remember what Venison gave him."
- L2111 (Keemin (DM)): "So Jamison threw a hammer at Fig after Fig could not give him an answer."
- L2112 (Evanora (Juls)): "Okay, okay."
- L2113 (Evanora (Juls)): "Mm-hmm."
- L2114 (Evanora (Juls)): "OK."
- L2115 (Keemin (DM)): "Yeah, exactly. So, um, Jamison asked Figg, like, what was the first thing I traded you on the first day we got here, which was three weeks ago. Figg was not able to recall, and Jamison threw a hammer at him, and we've gone into initiative, and everyone's currently trying to decide what to do on their turns. It was your turn before, but we're circling back to you."
- L2116 (Evanora (Juls)): "Okay, so quick question. Did it immediately start as soon as the blog started talking?"
- L2117 (Keemin (DM)): "did what immediately start?"
- L2118 (Evanora (Juls)): "Fig acting weird"
- L2119 (Evanora (Juls)): "I'm gonna..."
- L2120 (Keemin (DM)): "Uh, kinda, yeah. Yeah, or like the moment he came into the blue room."
- L2121 (Evanora (Juls)): "I'm gonna send an algex blast at his face at umzoplonk"
- L2122 (Louis (Jojo)): "Okay."
- L2123 (Keemin (DM)): "He is in a cage, but, I mean, you still certainly can."
- L2124 (Evanora (Juls)): "Oh, okay. Actually, then let me tell the dead his ass."
- L2125 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay."
- L2126 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Hell yeah! That's what I like!"
- L2127 (Evanora (Juls)): "So I need a wisdom save of 15, please."
- L2128 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay"
- L2129 (Snowflake (Panda)): "That Old Xoblob has a lot of dead on his toll."
- L2130 (Keemin (DM)): "I will roll for Old Xoblob."
- L2131 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "There's a music change too, so you know that's not good."
- L2132 (Louis (Jojo)): "Uh-huh."
- L2133 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Loo-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo!"
- L2134 (Evanora (Juls)): "I don't know what..."
- L2135 (Keemin (DM)): "Please roll for the damage. I'll say he rolls like a two."
- L2136 (Keemin (DM)): "Nope."
- L2137 (Evanora (Juls)): "okay uh does he have previous damage or no does he have full health okay so that is a d8"
- L2138 (Evanora (Juls)): "Mm-hmm."
- L2139 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay, regardless, as Old Xoblob takes some amount of necrotic damage, four points of necrotic damage, the lights in all of his eyes, like, flicker like a bulb losing electricity. But the grin on his face does not subside."
- L2140 (Keemin (DM)): "and as the lights flicker back on the purple glow begins to increase as he starts to cackle and as he does as the purple light basks all of you well first of all you all feel very uneasy as like the psychic effects of Old Xoblob are kind of being cranked up to the max for whatever reason in response to Evanora's attack"
- L2141 (Keemin (DM)): "But what's more concerning..."
- L2142 (Keemin (DM)): "is what begins to happen to Fig."
- L2143 (Keemin (DM)): "Oz"
- L2144 (Keemin (DM)): "Big"
- L2145 (Keemin (DM)): "the destabilization that was happening until now starts accelerating, like amplifying to the point where like he's like barely coherently in one place at any given time it looks like he's like you know like moving in one location and then the other and Snowflake at this moment the the wounded scarred eye that that injury that you received from the void critter back in the pits of Nuzah it throbs as"
- L2146 (Keemin (DM)): "Your vision goes full, like, purplish, and you start getting flashbacks of the creature. It's dripping maul. And what, as your vision clears, what you see in front of you, that used to be Fig, is Something else"
- L2147 (Keemin (DM)): "Entirely."
- L2148 (Snowflake (Panda)): "I attack!"
- L2149 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Meeya, Reese"
- L2150 (Keemin (DM)): "Yep, so we'll continue with the current edition that's rolled. And so, I guess we'll just go back from the top of the turn order. But I guess, before we go into turn order, to describe what's happening with Fig a little bit. Where is this? Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
- L2151 (Keemin (DM)): "You can still hear his voice, but it's very muffled and odd. I guess I'll change the music as well."
- L2152 (Louis (Jojo)): "Can't really hear the music very well."
- L2153 (Evanora (Juls)): "Unfortunately can't hear it."
- L2154 (Keemin (DM)): "I'm fine, I'm fine. I see AP, hate AP."
- L2155 (Keemin (DM)): "As Fig seemingly starts to say and utter Old Xoblob's trademark phrase, as you glance back over towards Old Xoblob and he's completely slumped over, whatever purple glow was in his eyes is completely gone, as he has just completely like fallen, unconscious it seems, and there's no semblance of purple lights coming off of him at all. But over at Fig,"
- L2156 (Keemin (DM)): "Something is blooming in his body as..."
- L2157 (Keemin (DM)): "he he starts to like jerk backwards you you hear like the sickening crack of like whatever bones or whatever structure is inside of fig as it snaps and shifts and rearranges his shoulders bulging outwards his entire body like growing as"
- L2158 (Keemin (DM)): "He is elongating, claws splitting, his tail like splitting into more, it basically looks like whatever Fig is, his entire body is like rapidly budding and duplicating and growing like a cancerous mass, as even his eyes start to like unnaturally split into more and more, everything tinged with purple, as more spikes burst through his body, they look almost like crystalline in nature, not completely different from the Arcanum shards that you've seen from before, as through gritted teeth he yells, RUN, RUN, BEFORE, I SEE YOU"
- L2159 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Wow!"
- L2160 (Keemin (DM)): "And at the top of the turn order, we'll have Louis."
- L2161 (Louis (Jojo)): "Haha Thank you."
- L2162 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Blanket"
- L2163 (Louis (Jojo)): "Well, Louis doesn't want to kill Fig. Can he? I doubt I can. But does Louis see any sort of..."
- L2164 (Snowflake (Panda)): "It was awesome!"
- L2165 (Louis (Jojo)): "Okay, we'll get to that, uh, does Louis like sort of see any point of this where maybe there's like"
- L2166 (Louis (Jojo)): "a core or center of this, like maybe where Fig's main body is that he can rip out of this giant creature and maybe pull it apart?"
- L2167 (Keemin (DM)): "There's no distinct separation or anything. It's not like there's some kind of creature enveloping Fig's main body. Fig himself has grown and mutated into this grotesque, horrifying monstrosity."
- L2168 (Louis (Jojo)): "Okay."
- L2169 (Louis (Jojo)): "I'm gonna hit him"
- L2170 (Louis (Jojo)): "I'm gonna non-lethally hit him though, because if this is hopefully still Fig in there, I don't want to kill Fig."
- L2171 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay."
- L2172 (Louis (Jojo)): "Alrighty. Go Spinny Thingy!"
- L2173 (Louis (Jojo)): "That is a 15 to hit."
- L2174 (Keemin (DM)): "15 will hit"
- L2175 (Louis (Jojo)): "Alrighty, and then, Jamison is behind him, so I do get sneak attacking."
- L2176 (Louis (Jojo)): "Uh, so I shall first do sneak attack damage... Oh, wrong side, it's over here. Okay, so that is four points of sneak attack damage, and then regular damage is..."
- L2177 (Louis (Jojo)): "Six plus nine for the short sword."
- L2178 (Keemin (DM)): "All right, and..."
- L2179 (Louis (Jojo)): "So, a total of 13."
- L2180 (Keemin (DM)): "13 points of damage, you skewer this abomination straight through its center, and as a blast of ichor spews forth under high pressure, you see the lights in what used to be Fig's eyes flicker violently, as he is technically reduced to Cyril hit points. And so, for now, it seems like, you know, you guys have completely reduced him down, but, and yet, you know, not unlike that Minotaur, I suppose, his limbs are still, like, thrashing about and moving, the lights are flickering, everything's kind of, like, glitching out, but he's still very much seemingly alive as... Anything else on your turn, Louis?"
- L2181 (Louis (Jojo)): "Uh, he's not gonna strike him again, he's gonna look down and think of it like, buddy, I know you're in there, come on. We need our spiky little buddy back."
- L2182 (Louis (Jojo)): "I don't know if I could throw pocket jerky at them. I don't know."
- L2183 (Keemin (DM)): "Uh, if you throw a Poggy Jerky at him, I'll let you attempt to roll a... like a... check. Um..."
- L2184 (Keemin (DM)): "Maybe Persuasion or Animal Handling."
- L2185 (Louis (Jojo)): "Ironically, I'm better at handling it. I'll take it."
- L2186 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Mwahahahaha!"
- L2187 (Evanora (Juls)): "or Emsi."
- L2188 (Louis (Jojo)): "I know, I have a 0 in persuasion but a 2 in animal handling. Alright, so go!"
- L2189 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Laughs"
- L2190 (Louis (Jojo)): "Ooh, that's real good. 17 plus 2 is 19, but I don't know if that's gonna do anything, or he might just eat my hand."
- L2191 (Keemin (DM)): "19. At the end of your turn, Louis, Fig will use, well, I mean, it is kind of odd. Well, first of all, I guess because you've, you know, brought him down to Cyril hit points, Fig's form starts to like flicker and destabilize. But something about his crystals seems to activate at this moment as, although a lot of the crystals like kind of flash completely off, whatever energy that's like emanated out from them seems to reinvigorate Fig as he will go into phase two."
- L2192 (Evanora (Juls)): "Weissmann, Bruker."
- L2193 (Louis (Jojo)): "Remember guys, we don't want to kill Fig. He's in there somewhere."
- L2194 (Keemin (DM)): "One sec."
- L2195 (Louis (Jojo)): "That's all I got."
- L2196 (Keemin (DM)): "Alright, um..."
- L2197 (Keemin (DM)): "Evanora, your turn."
- L2198 (Evanora (Juls)): "Okay, I..."
- L2199 (Louis (Jojo)): "Let me fix my head points. They should be at 20, not 22."
- L2200 (Evanora (Juls)): "If I did told the dead he isn't phase 2, would it still be considered like he has already taken damage?"
- L2201 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Just a tag, Old Xoblob!"
- L2202 (Evanora (Juls)): "and Lynn."
- L2203 (Keemin (DM)): "It seems like the crystals have like fully restored his form and actually has done even more as currently like his limbs. It's strange, like normally there's just spikes all over Fig's body. But right now there's like the crystals, the spikes. And now that he's been revived, his limbs are like transforming into the shape of different weapons. Like at one point, it's a great sword and then it flickers into a great axe. But it's all like this like blackened eldritch like mass. But the metallic parts are still there."
- L2204 (Evanora (Juls)): "Okay, and then it's all belong, it's still like none."
- L2205 (Evanora (Juls)): "How are you looking?"
- L2206 (Keemin (DM)): "Zablud looks kind of unconscious. He's just like, curled up on the ground. All the purple stuff from him is seemingly gone."
- L2207 (Evanora (Juls)): "and I make the assumption that he transferred into Fig."
- L2208 (Keemin (DM)): "You can make the assumption, sure, like, it does seem very odd, but like, Fig is saying wasop-loppy things too, like, like, you know, like the I-C-B-A-to-P and stuff."
- L2209 (Evanora (Juls)): "That's why I'm saying that he'd transfer into Sen"
- L2210 (Keemin (DM)): "I can't really answer that question, like you wouldn't know, but you see what you see."
- L2211 (Evanora (Juls)): "Okay, um..."
- L2212 (Evanora (Juls)): "I'll just tell the dead end, I need a wisdom save the team."
- L2213 (Keemin (DM)): "Brum"
- L2214 (Evanora (Juls)): "from Ping."
- L2215 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay."
- L2216 (Keemin (DM)): "That is an 18 on the Wisdom save."
- L2217 (Louis (Jojo)): "and Snowflake."
- L2218 (Evanora (Juls)): "And that's all I can do, actually."
- L2219 (Evanora (Juls)): "I'm going to move a little bit farther towards the door."
- L2220 (Evanora (Juls)): "and out of the range."
- L2221 (Keemin (DM)): "OK."
- L2222 (Keemin (DM)): "Snowflake, it's your turn."
- L2223 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Wait, wait, wait, wait, um, do I see anything? Like how does Fig look like through my vision?"
- L2224 (Keemin (DM)): "Oh yeah, your vision, for whatever reason, went like full purple and Fig looks like it's almost glowing. For you, it almost feels like time is slightly slowed to the point where you can track his movements much better. For the duration of your attacks against Fig right now, you will have plus one to all of your attack rolls."
- L2225 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Woo! Attack! I don't care if he survives, he's touched by the thing that I hate the most in this world!"
- L2226 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Twenty-four."
- L2227 (Keemin (DM)): "And with a 23, it's a 24, oh, well no, not quite, 23 because you are missing hit points, right?"
- L2228 (Snowflake (Panda)): "but I have plus one because of the vision."
- L2229 (Snowflake (Panda)): "I do."
- L2230 (Keemin (DM)): "Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah, fair enough. Please roll for the damage that hits. But as you hit, you will also take three points of piercing damage reflected off as Fig's, like, many spikes and, you know, all the stuff covering his body pierces back into you as you strike forward for... Do you have sneak attack active? Or available? Okay, cool. So 13 whole points of damage that Fig will take."
- L2231 (Keemin (DM)): "As he does so, Snowflake, you see something weird about his movement where, like, he is Figgs, still kind of, like, he's very animalistic and also, like, glitching out, but, like, like I said, like, the weapons that are, like, shifting, forming from his limbs and retracting and turning into different weapons, the moment you strike with an uncharacteristically, like, practiced, precise, you know, very clean, immaculate technique, he will riposte and immediately strike back at you as his arm turns into a warhammer for a second."
- L2232 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Hmm"
- L2233 (Keemin (DM)): "But it's a natural one, so completely misses."
- L2234 (Louis (Jojo)): "Uh-huh, I don't know."
- L2235 (Keemin (DM)): "That is his reaction. Anything else on your turn, Snowflake?"
- L2236 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Tech in the Tech! Let's go!"
- L2237 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay, second attack hits."
- L2238 (Keemin (DM)): "Oh yeah, you are. Yep."
- L2239 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Well, technically, I'm below the half that I have."
- L2240 (Keemin (DM)): "So you'd be at 2 points of exhaustion, but it still hits. 19."
- L2241 (Keemin (DM)): "So I believe..."
- L2242 (Snowflake (Panda)): "I think it's just five."
- L2243 (Keemin (DM)): "Well, do you have, um, are you just using two-weapon fighting?"
- L2244 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Yep."
- L2245 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Yep, yep."
- L2246 (Snowflake (Panda)): "All right."
- L2247 (Keemin (DM)): "Then it would just be the dice only, not the modifier, so it would just be 1. Nick him again, and you take 3 points of piercing damage again."
- L2248 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Ow! That hurts!"
- L2249 (Keemin (DM)): "It's Fig's turn."
- L2250 (Keemin (DM)): "The bees, the bees. As Fig will make two attacks, I'll say that they'll be towards Louis. So first attack is a 17 to hit."
- L2251 (Louis (Jojo)): "Yep."
- L2252 (Keemin (DM)): "Second is a 21."
- L2253 (Louis (Jojo)): "Yep."
- L2254 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Thanks for watching and don't forget to please leave a Like and Subscribe"
- L2255 (Keemin (DM)): "Once again, Fig's attacks are very precise, as they seem a little bit strange for... Like, they seem very different from the Fig that you know, as his weapon suddenly turns into a rapier, and he, like, with expert technique, lunges towards you, Louis, hitting you with a one-two combo, the first of which will be a trip attack, as I need you to roll a strength saving throw. The DC is 14."
- L2256 (Louis (Jojo)): "OK."
- L2257 (Louis (Jojo)): "fours, plus two, so."
- L2258 (Louis (Jojo)): "Ooh, that's real good. That is a 21 for me."
- L2259 (Louis (Jojo)): "Step in, minus seven, ehhh, do I want to just take the seven damage or not?"
- L2260 (Louis (Jojo)): "I'll take the 7 damage, I'll just take it for now"
- L2261 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay, and the second attack will be a sweeping attack as..."
- L2262 (Keemin (DM)): "Snowflake, does a 21 hit you?"
- L2263 (Snowflake (Panda)): "It does!"
- L2264 (Keemin (DM)): "You take another 4 points of damage as, mid-swing, the rapier transforms into a greataxe as Fig sweeps across the ground, hitting both you and Louis. Louis for 13 points of damage, Snowflake for 4."
- L2265 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Alright."
- L2266 (Louis (Jojo)): "I will take a level of exhaustion, so I only take three."
- L2267 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay."
- L2268 (Louis (Jojo)): "However, that will put me definitely below my health."
- L2269 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Hmm, I think I will take a level of exhaustion too."
- L2270 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay, sounds good."
- L2271 (Louis (Jojo)): "I definitely am more at the bloody state because I'm now at 10 out of 24."
- L2272 (Keemin (DM)): "Ooh, okay, so you're at five points of exhaustion now? Or six? Six, yeah."
- L2273 (Louis (Jojo)): "I believe five, I think, because I was at three. Yep, no, six."
- L2274 (Keemin (DM)): "Well, you took one point, and then two more from being bloodied, so minus three on your rolls. Yeah, Fig hits very, very brutally hard with this new weaponry. That will be his turn, as Jamison, it's your turn."
- L2275 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Ugh, okay."
- L2276 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Beat him!"
- L2277 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "and Harcourt."
- L2278 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Okay, um..."
- L2279 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Boys, now's the time to use this. That's the question."
- L2280 (Louis (Jojo)): "Rajay"
- L2281 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Mm, well."
- L2282 (Snowflake (Panda)): "and Hippo. Bye for now."
- L2283 (Keemin (DM)): "I think we just."
- L2284 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Okay, Jamison's first gonna, I guess, kind of..."
- L2285 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "like start circling around Fig."
- L2286 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "and um..."
- L2287 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Thanks for watching"
- L2288 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "He's going to..."
- L2289 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "I'm just going to yell out to Snowflake."
- L2290 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "And he's just going to say. Snowflake"
- L2291 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "I know it looks bad, but I think you're gonna be okay!"
- L2292 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "as, uh, let's see, I gotta go to this one."
- L2293 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "And I'm going to..."
- L2294 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "As Snowflake, you'll regain 7 hit points."
- L2295 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Oh my god, thank you!"
- L2296 (Keemin (DM)): "Nice. No longer bloodied."
- L2297 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "and then"
- L2298 (Snowflake (Panda)): "No longer bloodied!"
- L2299 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "And then Jamison is going to attack with..."
- L2300 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "He's gonna take out his, uh... is Pitchfork."
- L2301 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "and he's gonna try to hit Thig."
- L2302 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Ooh, that should hit. 24."
- L2303 (Keemin (DM)): "A 24 will hit indeed"
- L2304 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "So, 10 points of damage, and he will need to make..."
- L2305 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Uhhhh"
- L2306 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "A con save."
- L2307 (Keemin (DM)): "Conceive"
- L2308 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "So, con save of 16?"
- L2309 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "I think that's how that works."
- L2310 (Keemin (DM)): "He fails. 7-11."
- L2311 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "So he is proned as I sweep him off his feet."
- L2312 (Keemin (DM)): "Oh, okay, Fig is immune to prone as his body flips over, but his limbs, like, dislocate and re-ground themselves backwards, as he's still somehow managing to stand as, like, a third limb bursts out from his body and anchors him further."
- L2313 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Um, that's just cheating!"
- L2314 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "That'll be it for Jamison."
- L2315 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay"
- L2316 (Keemin (DM)): "Louis, back to your turn."
- L2317 (Louis (Jojo)): "I was just gonna move so he's over here, kind of blocking s- I don't know if I can sort of move Snowflake a little bit out of the way so she doesn't get hit again."
- L2318 (Keemin (DM)): "You can try to step in between, sure."
- L2319 (Louis (Jojo)): "That's what I want to do, and I'm assuming this counts as flanking with Jamison, right?"
- L2320 (Keemin (DM)): "Sure."
- L2321 (Louis (Jojo)): "So then I get a plus 2 to my attacks, which means it's now a minus 1."
- L2322 (Louis (Jojo)): "However, because I did hit him with my short sword last turn, I get advantage."
- L2323 (Louis (Jojo)): "because of X."
- L2324 (Keemin (DM)): "Oh, cool. Okay."
- L2325 (Louis (Jojo)): "I'm planning this. Let's see if I survive. Okay. So, uh, first attack... is... well, the first set is... that's a 7 on the dice for a... 5, 6, 7, 9... No, I did math wrong, 7."
- L2326 (Louis (Jojo)): "12 which go down to 11 with the second row is a 17 plus 5 minus 1."
- L2327 (Louis (Jojo)): "Which I hope hits, unless Fig's got a..."
- L2328 (Keemin (DM)): "What are the two rolls total? Sorry, I missed it."
- L2329 (Louis (Jojo)): "So the first one was a 7 plus 5 minus 1. The second one is a 17 plus 5 minus 1."
- L2330 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay, the second attack will hit."
- L2331 (Louis (Jojo)): "Okay, uh, for the..."
- L2332 (Keemin (DM)): "And I believe, because this is your second attack, you can still benefit from a sneak attack, but it'll just be the dice roll on the weapon damage."
- L2333 (Louis (Jojo)): "N-no, this is the first one. I was just rolling the advantage cuz of the Nick."
- L2334 (Keemin (DM)): "Oh, oh, oh, gotcha, okay, okay."
- L2335 (Louis (Jojo)): "I don't know why I rolled it in, but I rolled it in and I have a 9 on the attack because I gotta... I'll just roll it here. It's fine."
- L2336 (Louis (Jojo)): "for 9 on the normal short sword damage and then the sneak attack"
- L2337 (Louis (Jojo)): "I just have to roll a d6 on here, because I don't technically... 2 on the sneak attack damage for a total of 11, and I'm trying to non-lethally hit Fig."
- L2338 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay, cool. Non-lethally hit Fig for 11 points of damage. That will end combat as Fig is going to..."
- L2339 (Keemin (DM)): "Let out a giant screech, as I will need everyone at least to, except for Evanora, I'd say you're far enough away, to roll a Strength saving throw."
- L2340 (Keemin (DM)): "as the sound waves from the screech begin to hurl you backwards."
- L2341 (Louis (Jojo)): "Shit. Natural one, baby."
- L2342 (Evanora (Juls)): "Useless."
- L2343 (Snowflake (Panda)): "All of you."
- L2344 (Keemin (DM)): "Okay, you don't take any damage, but are essentially like, like, explosively blasted away from Fig, landing prone, um..."
- L2345 (Evanora (Juls)): "Why is there so many natural ones? Holy shit."
- L2346 (Keemin (DM)): "Snowflake will go with 16, so you're good. You don't get pushed back. Jamison doesn't get pushed back either. It's just Louis. But as Fig falls onto the ground."
- L2347 (Louis (Jojo)): "I guess I'll put myself over here."
- L2348 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Bye."
- L2349 (Keemin (DM)): "Fig slumps down onto the ground as the crystals begin to start smoking and retracting and his body beginning to somehow kind of restore itself into a semblance of what it used to be before slowly but surely."
- L2350 (Keemin (DM)): "But the really odd part, and the part that I'm going to leave us..."
- L2351 (Keemin (DM)): "and the session tonight on..."
- L2352 (Keemin (DM)): "is that when you look back at Old Xoblob"
- L2353 (Keemin (DM)): "He opens his eyes."
- L2354 (Keemin (DM)): "and they have a clarity to them. They're not purple."
- L2355 (Keemin (DM)): "Instead, they're filled with tears."
- L2356 (Keemin (DM)): "as he looks at each of you slowly."
- L2357 (Keemin (DM)): "Like he's trying to burn the memory of your faces into his eyes as in a coarse voice. He says. You"
- L2358 (Keemin (DM)): "You're alive! Oh, I'm a wanderer."
- L2359 (Keemin (DM)): "You're still alive."
- L2360 (Keemin (DM)): "His eyes land on Fig's body."
- L2361 (Keemin (DM)): "as something shifts. And he says..."
- L2362 (Keemin (DM)): "Ow."
- L2363 (Keemin (DM)): "Jax"
- L2364 (Keemin (DM)): "And that will be the end of tonight's session."
- L2365 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Did you say Jax?"
- L2366 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Oh!"
- L2367 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Is that a character?"
- L2368 (Louis (Jojo)): "new character unlocked playable content dlc"
- L2369 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Now just looking at the, looking at the ground, does Fig, I know we've never really seen Fig's face because of the like cloak and stuff. Is there, is there a, like a different body?"
- L2370 (Keemin (DM)): "Asfig"
- L2371 (Keemin (DM)): "returns back to his usual form, you get a pretty good look at his face and there's not too much that's different from the rest of his body. It's just like horribly twisted and it's kind of like rotten like gnarled wood bark that makes up his face and like peeking out from like the little you know cracks are these brightly shiny little eyes. Yeah, that's what you see."
- L2372 (Evanora (Juls)): "Hmm."
- L2373 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Two or multiple?"
- L2374 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Okay, and is Jamison..."
- L2375 (Evanora (Juls)): "Hildreth"
- L2376 (Keemin (DM)): "Oh, there's like, there's like, there's like eight of them. Or actually, not that he's like, kind of reverted back, there's like four of them."
- L2377 (Evanora (Juls)): "and"
- L2378 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "And as Jamison looks up, are there cameras in this room?"
- L2379 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Definitely!"
- L2380 (Keemin (DM)): "There are not."
- L2381 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Wait, what?"
- L2382 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "That'll do."
- L2383 (Louis (Jojo)): "That'll do, pig, that'll do."
- L2384 (Evanora (Juls)): "Aries."
- L2385 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Hey, we can talk to Old Xoblob now. He could've seen something."
- L2386 (Evanora (Juls)): "Rino"
- L2387 (Louis (Jojo)): "Saba, what's this? Answers to life."
- L2388 (Snowflake (Panda)): "Hehehe"
- L2389 (Louis (Jojo)): "Have you heard of our lord and savior, Meepo?"
- L2390 (Evanora (Juls)): "Meepo"
- L2391 (Snowflake (Panda)): "LAUGHING"
- L2392 (Louis (Jojo)): "Yeah."
- L2393 (Evanora (Juls)): "Yeah, that's why Evanora is..."
- L2394 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "We gotta see if that deer's still in there. There might be another baddie on the other side of that door."
- L2395 (Evanora (Juls)): "That's why Evanora's all the way over there."
- L2396 (Evanora (Juls)): "Oh no, Meepo responded."
- L2397 (Jamison (BrassOnes)): "Meepo is still listening."
- L2398 (Louis (Jojo)): "Okay."
