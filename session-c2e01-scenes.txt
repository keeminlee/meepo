Introduction to the campaign setting
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: All right, everybody. So let's jump into things. So I have like a quick intro narration of what's going on as we start the campaign. And then we'll hop right into what I have planned. So I guess to get us situated in the setting of campaign two. So 10 years have passed since the last world rune was discovered in the Blue Flame Isles, along with the unprecedented cataclysmic events that took place on the island, referred to now as the Void Incursion of Waterdeep. From the depths of destruction arose up a group of adventurers, the Waterdeep Seven, though their precise number seems to vary based on the account. Not much is known about how exactly the incursion was stopped, but all tales point to the Waterdeep Seven.
Offline Audio: The city of Waterdeep has made an incredible rebound from its near destruction, as after the Void Incursion was stopped, Lord Baen Zagrim, one of the Waterdeep Seven rose to power as the self-proclaimed new leader of Waterdeep's chapter of the Zhentarim and struck a historically unprecedented merger with the Open Lord of Waterdeep herself, Lady Silverbarrel, resulting in a more unified Waterdeep than ever before under their joint rule. Even High Priestesses Lily and Lilae of the Burū tribe approved of this alliance, further unifying Waterdeep into a young nation as all of its people, regardless of culture or creed, worked together to rebuild after the calamitous events of the Wildgreen Incident.
Offline Audio: A bustling fast-paced world of freedom and possibility. Meanwhile in the north, the Everfrost's barbarian tribes have kept most of their pillaging and marauding to themselves, and even the Forgotten Empire's thirst for conquest does not extend very far into the frozen wastes that they call home. In the city of Perigult, one of the Empire's crown jewel cities, continued advancements in art technology have both improved the lives and lined the pockets of many, all while their less presentable undercity, the Districts of Newza, experimented with a new, dangerous take on art tech known as chemtech. To the west, the Golden Nation of Kadim has never been one to sow chaos, which remains the case to this day as its vast military power stands imposing but still, just like its petrified guardians.
Offline Audio: and thankfully the long if not uneasy period of peace between Phaedrum and the Gorgothian Empire has held throughout the years, but whispers float on the wind from the east, where the floating isles of Aeolia, ancient prophecies and fresh rumors alike speak of impending upheaval of power approaching in the near future, the nation collectively holding its breath. In a real sense, the story of this campaign begins across all of Faeterra, featuring characters from everywhere from Paravolt to Gorgoth to even places beyond the reach of the Material Plane. But as fate, or perhaps a mysterious higher power, would decree, each of you from your wildly different walks of life have been united together by one devil by the name of Sir Caldus, who on a mysterious quest handpicked each of you to bring along, some by force, some by trickery, some by agreement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Arrival at the Immortal Bastion
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: to the Immortal Bastion, the capital city of the Noxian Empire. Those of you arriving at the Immortal Bastion for the first time would be awed by its sheer glory, a monolithic fortress not built into the land but imposed upon it, its walls carved from ancient volcanic stone, Noxian banners black and crimson waving and glaring downward from spiked battlements. The outer gates alone are tall enough to eclipse a mountain pass, sculpted with the reliefs of past champions locked in endless battle, though time and rust have blurred their features like forgotten gods. Truly an entrance worthy of Nox's capital, the cornerstone city of the most powerful empire Runeterra has ever seen.

Sir Kalvus, of course, isn't taking you sightseeing, though, as your destination is the Fleshing Arena, the world's largest stadium, home to the bloodiest
Offline Audio: The most anticipated gladiatorial event in all of Viterra, the Grand Reckoning, viewed by hundreds of thousands of arena-goers. The Reckoning symbolizes the very core of Gordaff's ideals. The weak perish brutally and in obscurity, yes, but for the fiercest competitors await unimaginable heights of fame and glory that comes with the title of Reckoner, one that inspires respect, if not outright fear, in the hearts of even the most seasoned fighters all across the world, as well as the combat prowess to match such notoriety. But perhaps it's a little too early to be daydreaming, as none of you are heroes, not yet. Because in this campaign, in this world, heroes are not born, they are forged in fire. Whether by boat or caravan, each of you and whatever unfortunates have accompanied you are brought in shackles to Fletcher

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Introduction of Minx and Uriah
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: which makes up the extensive prison system for housing all of its combatants, performers, and spectacles. We begin our very first scene of the campaign with a very out-of-place looking pair huddled together in a dimly lit room that seems much too large for just the two of them. As until today, Minx and Uriah, the two of you have been kept in little more than a cage receiving essentials through slats between the bars while you awaited your fate at the hands of Sir Caldus. Your mutual friend Bombobuff was carted away without explanation. Weeks later, Sir Caldus's men suddenly freed you from your cage and directed you towards what they called the waiting room. And here you are now, shivering in the cold as a draft of air continuously blows upward through a vent in the center of the room.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Meeting other captives
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: cold, unfeeling, with a guardian gauntlet, head to toe in architect-enhanced armor, a single beam of red light gleaming sinisterly from their half-helmets instead of a visible face. So I'm going to ask Minx to please introduce your character.

Alright, you see a short hobbit, maybe three to four feet tall, a furry little creature, ears like a fox, wide innocent eyes, an adorable little nose. She sits there with a cornered cat kind of look as she scans each and every one of them, and she does this kind of like hand gestures, almost like a coquettish.
Offline Audio: He is also dressed in a striking yellow, reminiscent of honey from beehives. The young boy next to you, clad in villager's clothing, kind of stares curiously at the hand gestures that you're making, and also looking around, there's a lot of fear in his eyes, in a slightly shaking voice, he says to you, 'Are you doing something?' 'Well, I'm, uh, I'm just, you know how these things normally go. You just gotta like tap, tap, tap around, and maybe something good might happen.'
Offline Audio: Don't worry, I have a very good feeling about this. You just gotta feel the flow, Eryiah. Close your eyes and think nothing but positive thoughts. Now imagine that the door in front of us is actually open.
Offline Audio: As the two of you look towards the door, another figure is thrust against the room. So I'm going to ask Rass to please introduce your character, Jamison.

So Jamison, although looking younger, is way, way more muscular for his age. He's got a farmer's tan, a rough short military haircut, and is kind of going to begin looking around and saluting some of the Borgothian troops that are stationed on the inside.
Offline Audio: Winks lowers her to Uriah. Stay behind me. Whatever happens, I'll make sure nothing bad happens to you. Excuse me, who are you guys? So there is a one-armed automaton with glowing eyes that is accompanying Jamison, and Jamison will just kind of look around and he meets Uriah, will approach Uriah, and extend his arm and just say, hey, how's it going buddy? Private Rogers here, you in for basic too? Is this where we start all our training?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Discussion of their situation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: They just watch Minx pop up. You know like frightened animals trying to puff their fur to look as big as possible.
Offline Audio: Why hello there, friends! We come in peace.
Offline Audio: Training? We're not here for training. We were captured.
Offline Audio: I think this is all just some big misunderstanding.
Offline Audio: You see a young man. He looks like you think like half-elf looking person that kind of has like almost like a greenish tint to his skin. He's got kind of like a ranger's or a hunter's garb and right now he has like a cloak and a hood that's pulled over his head. Pretty close so you can't really get a good look at his face. You can tell by the way he's constantly like looking around the room scanning everything and not really like leveling up the lady's face. Sillson immediately snaps to you from doing his push-ups and salutes. Oh my god, what's he doing? Private Rogers, reporting for duty. To the man you see a grizzled, definitely just at first glance seasoned explorer or maybe guide through forest and wilderness judging by his attire. It's like this very worn and very

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Realization of being captured
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: He's slightly hunched over in a way that might suggest that he suffered maybe an injury or something in his past, but as he kind of creases his throat, turns to you, Xero. It looks like they're rallying us up like chickens in a coop. Oh great, the time has finally come then. We have to fight for our survival in this pit. What a colorful bunch.
Offline Audio: We've been tricked. I saw through all along.
Offline Audio: Are these mechanical guards, do they have any visible weapons on them?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Introduction of Snowflake and Bacon
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: A goblin girl walks in with a large cat walking in a somewhat cautious.
Offline Audio: It's always white with the dark spots of a leopard.
Offline Audio: on all fours, just looking around, sniffing, and looking from one person to another, not minding the guards anymore, just treating them as part of the furniture. And then the eyes keep on the little furry, how do you say, mice? It's not mice, it's just a mink, like a bunny creature. And the eyes keep on growing to twice the size.
Offline Audio: I see looking goblin about just about that big catch height when she's down on all fours. But she's got a strut to her that makes it seem like she should be three, four times her size as she kind of has the walk of a seasoned fighter as your friend Bacon looks around and pinches Snowflake and kind of just not even trying to lower her voice, just straight up asks, "So who do you think we're supposed to fight in here? That one?" As she points at Jarvis. "Oh, you think that one?" As she catches you looking at Minx. Minx pops up again! Snowflake kind of like falls to the ground and starts crawling into the darker space, trying to break the eye contact

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Concerns about their surroundings
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: Is there a way to sneak?
Offline Audio: Jariah tries to put on a brave face, but you can see his hands are trembling.
Offline Audio: I don't even think we know where we are. I'm sorry about my friend.
Offline Audio: Mix smells like sunshine and honey.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sir Caldus's holographic message
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: I don't know how to explain it, but Snowflake would stop.
Offline Audio: Are you trying to hurt Minx or just hugging?
Offline Audio: There are no sharp points sticking into you, at least for the moment.
Offline Audio: As this happens, Jamison, as you start grabbing the scruff of Snowflake, you're fighting the urge to not go limp. The door opens one more time, this time not to two but four individuals.
Offline Audio: As they're escorted into the waiting room, Jules, I'm gonna let you introduce Eleanora.
Offline Audio: Next to her is a taller human male, blonde hair, in like a farmer's suit of sorts, very much next to her. He also looks very roughed up, kind of bloodied. On the way in, if you don't mind, you can describe. I don't think I've actually heard a physical description of them from you or Juliet, so I'd love to hear. On the way in, she is a—you can see by her ears, she is like an elf—she has white hair, about the same size, a little bit taller than Avanora, also elegantly dressed, high-ranked again, much like the other two.
Offline Audio: Define is also a tiefling. He is a red skin toned tiefling. His hair is also very much white.
Offline Audio: For once, every bit of easygoing glee has vanished from her face as she's in full alert mode.
Offline Audio: Why does everybody keep saying captured?
Offline Audio: as you approach him and in a very inappropriately just happy and jolly voice goes,
Offline Audio: All of their visors click into this coordinated movement that suggests they are synchronously pointing towards the center of the room as the red glow grows ever brighter before arcing forward into this beam of light that projects onto the center of the room a holographic image of someone that all of you are at least acquainted with at this point, Sir Caldus himself. As the buzzing and flickering image of Sir Caldus is now fully animates before you, he begins to speak in a slightly distorted tone.
Offline Audio: Welcome to the waiting room, my lovely lambs for the slaughter! I wish I could have joined to see you all gather up here in person, but circumstances had other ideas. Ah, so this will have to do. The life of a senior recruiter like myself is a bustling one. I'm sure you are just bursting with questions. Where am I? Why am I here? Is that blood on the walls? All in good time, sweetlings, don't spoil the surprise. She paces slowly within the holographic field, eyes scanning the room despite not really being present. Now here's what you do need to know. You've been chosen. Not for your charm, not for your intellect, not even for your sparkling personality. No, you're here because someone thinks you might just be entertaining.
Offline Audio: Before your new life properly begins, let's start with a simple exercise. Think of it as stretching before a big fight. His eyes narrow with delighted anticipation. This is the task: In the next hour--and I hope you've at least had a chance to get to know each other--I want each of you to line up from the door where you entered to the back wall, in the exact order of who you think would win in a one-on-one brawl. Classic flesh-and-arena rules: No rules. Weapons, teeth, spells, fists, claws, charming smiles, use whatever you've got. Here's the twist: Once that hour is up, your placement will be locked in, judged solely by how far you are from the entrance. That's right, physical distance, no excuses. And why does this matter? Oh, just a few consequences.
Offline Audio: This place is no different. Only the strong survive. But before we begin, we need to get one pesky little thing out of the way. Guards, collars please. As the guards step forward, each with a belt of dark steel chokers. One by one, they begin to approach to clasp them around your necks. Cold, seamless, light enough to forget, until you remember what they're for. As a single red circle glows right between your collarbones once they've been placed on. Sir Alex explains as the guards approach. These collars will serve three purposes. One, identification. Two, surveillance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Instructions for the challenge
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: Well, the hour starts now. Best of luck, my little golden darlings.
Offline Audio: No one coming within ten feet of the door.
Offline Audio: Do you have allies on the outside who will be looking for you?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Planning their strategy
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: and there's like a little pocket near it.
Offline Audio: No persuasion check at all, competing for the first report.
Offline Audio: The problems are definitely checked out. He's not lying.
Offline Audio: See if we can get a more smart location.
Offline Audio: spot your opportunity and make your way all the way to the front, basically like sticking yourself right on the other side of the door. By the time the two of you come back, you're going to have to try to pull him off, but as you do, you find that this Jamison guy is no joke, as the level of sheer strength that you feel from him as you're trying to get him to budge, this man definitely works out. This Jamison, your robot friend, Jarvis, Everybody, hold our spot. It's clear the experiment was a success. I'm not gonna lie, I don't even feel it in my legs anymore. This is fantastic. I'm happy for you.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Debate over positioning
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: This door is big! I can't protect all the door.
Offline Audio: Should I attack him?
Offline Audio: I'm not heard Shelpley talking at all, correct?
Offline Audio: As the dog pile near the door only grows, Olin clears his voice.
Offline Audio: in the flesh. These creatures are known to
Offline Audio: This place that is kind of straddling the line between fiction like fantasy and history known as Vandal City is basically a myth, a legend, and yet the resemblance is striking.
Offline Audio: And this time, you're currently here.
Offline Audio: I'm sorry, real quick, could you give a good definition of catfish?
Offline Audio: Calvin came by, said they were recruiting for like a way higher stakes kind of tournament. We thought that sounds exactly up our alley, and now we're here.

Wow, that sounds a lot better than being thrown into a cage.

Oh, well, I mean, we got thrown into a cage too. I mean, I rode here in a wagon. I mean, I guess maybe you could call it a cage, but...

Hmm.

Well, I'm glad you want to be here. It seems like this kind of thing is right up your alley. But some of us would like to leave and don't have that option. So, we want to make the best of the situation and not get killed. I suggest we get in the line as quick as possible and do it smart.

Well, what's everybody's names? I know that one's Snowflake.
Offline Audio: I don't know about being not in the front, but I know that Minx is no coward.
Offline Audio: Please do remind me.

Well, we were gonna work on you being a little braver, we were gonna take initiative. Now is not the time for your personality improvement tests. This is a test of survival. If your little friend here can't fight as strong as the rest of us, he should be at the back.

Well, I can fight good enough for the both of us.

But that's not a fine misrank.

If I may be honest, I don't find it doubtful anybody in this room could leave a scratch on me. However, it is a nice gesture to be in the back.

Exactly. Jarvis can stand up to anything, he just needs more confidence.

I point to the blonde guy on the left and I'm like, no offence, but you just put my thumb backwards.
Offline Audio: I'm going to the front with Lynx.
Offline Audio: You know, I single-handedly fought off Triferian guards before.
Offline Audio: The moment the collars go on, the shackles come off.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finalizing the order before the challenge
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: Are any of these colors any like magical?
Offline Audio: Although the best way to know for sure is to try blasting.
Offline Audio: Now the instructions, they said you're going in solo, correct?
Offline Audio: Wasting your time on this.
Offline Audio: I'll be right behind you.
Offline Audio: but I'll at least let you go in front of me.
Offline Audio: I thought that I was never going to be free again
Offline Audio: Meanwhile, Minx is going to wave her fingers and cast Minor Illusion.
Offline Audio: There is no argument for us, no play.
Offline Audio: I mean, honestly, from a player perspective, it could be a whole trap where the person who's in the front is actually in the rear. I wouldn't put it past the arena to play a little mind game on us like that, but in all seriousness, I guess I'll be sure to get the order in. I will say that as a character, Minx doesn't have the highest intelligence, and will try to be in the front. Snowflake is very competitive. Would Jameston know any type of...
Offline Audio: The triberics tends to be very hierarchical with its rankings
Offline Audio: All right, well, how about this?
Offline Audio: She's going to clap her hands and stands on two, giving out the first statement.
Offline Audio: Well, frankly, I am a little bit insulted that you think that I couldn't talk.
Offline Audio: Nope, I only got two ears.
Offline Audio: What's going on here? I mean, you said that stuff was going to do something to me, but I didn't think extra ears was part of the gift. Can you hear double as well? Does it sound louder? Maybe that's why I can hear you two. It's because of my new magical ears. I have one zero.
Offline Audio: Next in the order.
Offline Audio: And I guess the order as it is right now is Aphelia, then Bacon, then Cereal, then maybe Defiance, then Polin, Abner, Louis, Ambeline, Uriah, Garis.
Offline Audio: No, I don't know. That's the whole point. I want to be in the middle. I said this. I don't want to be in the- I'm gonna die if I'm too far out.
Offline Audio: You know, even though the order is supposed to be based on one-on-ones,
Offline Audio: Andoranian will just all die.
Offline Audio: Sir Caldus explicitly said that physical distance from the door is the only thing.
Offline Audio: I think we should try to go behind the tiefling woman and the tiefling man.
Offline Audio: All right, well it looks like this is just about
Offline Audio: So this will be the order. Yeah, and so I guess right as the double doors in front open as the hour passes, that will be the end of our session zero introductory prologue to the campaign, as what awaits you beyond the doors will be revealed to you in two weeks from now as we begin session one.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Session conclusion
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Offline Audio: This is probably a bad idea.
Offline Audio: All right, farewell y'all.
