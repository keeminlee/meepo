# Documentation Index

This index is the entry point for project docs. It separates active references from historical notes so contributors can find the right source quickly.

## Start Here

- [CURRENT_STATE.md](CURRENT_STATE.md) — current feature status, command surface, schema, and roadmap
- [Project_Meepo.md](Project_Meepo.md) — product vision and MeepoMind model

## Active References

- [OVERLAY.md](OVERLAY.md) — OBS overlay architecture and setup
- [MISSIONS_V0.md](MISSIONS_V0.md) — mission economy design and command behavior
- [CAUSAL_CORE_PHYSICS.md](CAUSAL_CORE_PHYSICS.md) — mass vs strength contract, rounds, and convergence behavior
- [../LOGGING_REFERENCE.md](../LOGGING_REFERENCE.md) — logging scopes and operations
- [../causal-debug.md](../causal-debug.md) — practical causal debug workflow

## Causal Pivot Notes (Implementation-Specific)

Use these when working directly on the chunkless link pivot workstream:

- [../ARCHITECTURE_CHUNKLESS_LINKS.md](../ARCHITECTURE_CHUNKLESS_LINKS.md)
- [../IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_CHUNKLESS_LINKS.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_CHUNKLESS_LINKS.md)
- [../CHUNKLESS_LINKS_INDEX.md](../CHUNKLESS_LINKS_INDEX.md)
- [../CHANGES_SUMMARY.md](../CHANGES_SUMMARY.md)
